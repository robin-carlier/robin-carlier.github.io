## About Me
I am a PhD student at ENS de Lyon, studying under the supervision of [Frédéric Déglise](http://deglise.perso.math.cnrs.fr/).

I am interested in A1-homotopy theory, derived algebraic geometry, higher category theory and the formalization
of the these fields in computer proof assistants systems.
## Preprints
- [Milnor-Witt K-theory and Witt K-theory of a field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16985) (07/2023).

## Other
I am a regular contributor to the open-source community project [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4),
contributing mathematics relevant to (ordinary and higher) category theory. Since June 2025, I am also part of the Mathlib reviewers team.
