## About Me
I am a PhD student at ENS de Lyon studying under the supervision of [Frédéric Déglise](http://deglise.perso.math.cnrs.fr/)

I am interested in a A1-homotopy theory, derived algebraic geometry as well as higher category theory.
## Preprints
- [Milnor-Witt K-theory and Witt K-theory of a field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16985) (07/2023).

## Some documents 
- A set of notes from talks I gave during Frédéric Déglise's [reading group on Morel's book "A1-Algebraic topology over a Field"](http://deglise.perso.math.cnrs.fr/Morel.html): [Unramified sheaves of sets](/documents/unramified_sheaves.pdf).
