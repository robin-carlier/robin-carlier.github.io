## About Me
I am a M2 student at ENS de Lyon, following courses on arithmetic geometry and number theory.

I am interested in a broad range of mathematics, including but not limited to: algebraic geometry, A1-homotopy theory, category theory. 

## Some documents
Here are a few documents I produced so far during my education. Most of them are in French. 
- [l-adic cohomology, Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich formula and the Weil Conjectures](/documents/rapport_m1.pdf), M1 Master thesis under the supervision of Prof. Joseph Ayoub.
- [Localisation theorem in A1-homotopy](/documents/gluing.pdf) (WIP).
- Two set of notes from talks I gave during Frédéric Déglise's [reading group on Morel's book "A1-Algebraic topology over a Field"](http://deglise.perso.math.cnrs.fr/Morel.html): [Unramified sheaves of sets](/documents/unramified.pdf) and [Milnor-Witt K-theory](/documents/milnor-witt.pdf)
